For different clients all you need to do is changing the listening port, like that:

pyethapp # defaults to 30303
eth --listen 30304 --no-ipc
geth --port 30305 # default ipc
parity --port 30306
In ethereumj you can configure the port in the config file, e.g., 30307.
Never was able to change the port in pyethapp though.
Running parity in --geth mode here would conflict with geth,
 depending on your needs you should disable ipc on all clients except one,
 the example above defaults to geth ipc.

Same client
For multiple instances of the same client, you would also have to adjust the data directory.

geth # defaults to port 30303 and ~/.ethereum
geth --port 30304 --datadir ~/.ethereum-04
geth --port 30305 --datadir ~/.ethereum-05
geth --port 30306 --datadir ~/.ethereum-06

geth account list 


geth export C:\\newBlockchainFile # copy blockchain to file


geth --datadir "C:\Ethereum"  # change data dir where geth stores all data
